Project Challenges for freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification

## Palindrome Checker
Returns true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, returns false.

> A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing. --fCC challenge description

**Note:** All non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) removed, lowercase applied.

## Roman Numeral Converter
Converts the given number into a Roman numeral.

## Caesars Cipher
Encodes string as ROT13 input and returns a decoded string.

> A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on. --fCC challenge description

**Note:** Only uppercase string input functions as required by this challenge. Non-alphabetic characters (i.e. spaces, punctuation) are not mutated in final string.
